        ###### Instructions ######
        # Compute the elastic forces acting on the nodes at the ends of the cable.
        ### Input:  `coordinates` is an array containing the coordinates of the nodes at the ends of the cable.
        #           The dimension of the coordinates is given by the attribute `self.dim`.
        #           The shape of `coordinates` is therefore (2, self.dim),
        #           so the coordinates of the first node are `coordinates[0, :]`
        #           and the coordinates of the second node are `coordinates[1, :]`.
        ### Output: `nodes_forces` should represent the forces acting on the nodes at the ends of the cable.
        #           This variable should be defined in your code as either:
        #               - an array of shape (2, self.dim),
        #               - or a list of two lists of length `self.dim` each.
        ### Notes:
        #           - The square root function is available in the numpy module as `np.sqrt`.
        #           - The dot product of two vectors `a` and `b` can be computed as `np.dot(a, b)`.
        #           - Your implementation can assume that self.dim is equal to 3 for the tests to pass.
        #           - The variable `self.stiffness` is the stiffness of the cable.
